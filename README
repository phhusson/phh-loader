We need GPT so that partitions are named, which is a requirement for Android.
However, the RPI's VC bootloader doesn't know about GPT, so we need a Hybrid MBR.

Start by creating a GPT partition table. You'll need a 32MB metadata partition, 10GB super partition, and then whatever you want in userdata partition.

Once this is done, use util-linux's fdisk (I have 2.33.1). If it asks whether to use GPT or MBR, select GPT
Then use the command `M` to switch to the MBR
Remove all MBR's partitions (`d` command multiple times for all partitions)

Then create the FAT boot partition as number 1:
n
1
8192
532479
(if it asks to remove partition's formating mark, refuse)
t
c

Now create GPT partition, as number 2:
n
2
1
8191
t
ee

Then write: `w`
For some reason, it doesn't exit here, but you can use `q` now
